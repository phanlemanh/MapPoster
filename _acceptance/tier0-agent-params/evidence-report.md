# Evidence Report: tier0-agent-params

_Round 10 — nghiệm thu lại do `535ee8e8` (nhánh `chore/remove-dead-centroidof`) chạm hai file dùng chung `mcp-server/src/geometry.ts` và `mcp-server/src/resolveConfig.ts`. Nội dung commit: XOÁ hàm chết `centroidOf` khỏi geometry.ts (−22 dòng), xoá khối test riêng của nó khỏi geometry.test.ts (−13), gỡ tên `centroidOf` khỏi câu import ở resolveConfig.ts:7, và bật `noUnusedLocals` trong mcp-server/tsconfig.json (+6)._

_Soi diff: KHÔNG một đường chạy runtime nào đổi. `centroidOf` không có người gọi nào ngoài chính test của nó — trước khi xoá, `grep -rn "centroidOf"` toàn repo chỉ ra đúng ba loại chỗ: định nghĩa, khối test, và một cái tên nằm trong danh sách import ở resolveConfig.ts mà thân file không bao giờ tham chiếu tới. resolveConfig.ts:474 vẫn tính tâm vùng inline từ bbox y nguyên, không đổi một ký tự — hàm bị xoá KHÔNG được nối vào đó, vì `bboxOfGeojsons` duyệt mọi feature của collection còn `centroidOf` chỉ nhận một geometry, nối vào sẽ bỏ sót feature với vùng nhiều mảnh. `noUnusedLocals` là cờ thời-biên-dịch, không sinh mã. Vì vậy mọi AC của hợp đồng này đứng nguyên trên cùng một hành vi._

_`executors.test.resolve_config` nằm trong tập eval của hợp đồng này nên được chạy lại. `tier0_invariants` vẫn giữ đủ, gồm mọi guard tham số vừa ĐỊNH NGHĨA vừa ĐƯỢC GỌI._

_Đã chạy lại toàn bộ tập executor của hợp đồng này chứ không ghim suông. Thay đổi số đếm test duy nhất trong cả repo: `mcp-server/src/geometry.test.ts` còn 10 test thay vì 12 — đúng hai case của `centroidOf` vừa xoá, không case nào khác. Bộ đầy đủ: tsc -b exit 0, tsc -p mcp-server exit 0 (đã bật noUnusedLocals), vitest 496 pass / 7 skip / 0 fail, playwright 14 pass, test:mcp 7 pass, cả bảy script bất biến đều giữ._

_`verified_commit` cập nhật lên `535ee8e8`; `human_signoff` xoá trắng và `status` hạ `signed-off` → `implemented` theo chốt file-dùng-chung — chữ ký người thuộc Cổng 2 và phải nằm ở commit riêng._

_Round 9 — re-pin only, triggered by `ce0b13e` (test-only commit on `fix/mcp-auth`, scoped entirely to `mcp-server/src/http.test.ts`: mcp-auth's own E6 fix, rebinding its 'bind outside loopback with a token' test from `'127.0.0.1'` — itself loopback, so the assertion never reached the code path it claimed to cover — to a genuine non-loopback host `'0.0.0.0'`). `git diff e5ce7199..ce0b13e6 --stat` touches only that one test file; no source file changed. Re-ran this contract's broad guards and any eval whose command executes `http.test.ts` (E12, E19, E20); all matched the prior round exactly. Every other eval was NOT re-run — its own source/test files are untouched by this commit — and is re-pinned as-is. `verified_commit` updated to `ce0b13e6de6504aa53d3bc0fe5545f209ec00381`; `human_signoff` stays empty._

_Round 8 — re-verification triggered by `fix/mcp-auth` landing on top of Round 7's `verified_commit` (`27e1be1a`). `git diff 27e1be1a..HEAD --stat` touches only `mcp-server/src/http.ts`, `mcp-server/src/http.test.ts`, `README.md`, and files under `_acceptance/**` — none of which are this contract's own primary source files. Contract `status` downgraded `signed-off` → `implemented` per the shared-file staleness guard; `human_signoff` cleared._

_Diff review: `http.ts`'s change is a pure extraction — the three copied `if (token && authorization !== ...)` bearer checks on `/render`, `/render-clip`, `/jobs` are replaced with calls to one shared `rejectedByBearer()` helper implementing byte-identical logic, and a NEW guard call is added on the previously-unguarded `/mcp` fall-through plus a NEW startup-time fail-closed check for non-loopback binds without a token. This contract's own eval commands were re-run fresh against the new commit rather than merely re-pinned, since the shared file is in scope of at least one of them; every run matched the prior round's pass counts exactly — no regression from the refactor._

## Analyst

Baseline values are carried forward unchanged from the prior round per the re-verification instruction (`fix/mcp-auth` is additive/refactor-only to a shared file and does not recompute this contract's own pre-feature diffBase). Non-discriminating (green on both) per the carried-forward baseline: E19, E20.

## Variance

none — every command this round is a deterministic single run.

## Iterations

Round 9 (re-pin): triggered by test-only commit `ce0b13e` (mcp-auth's own E6 fix). Re-ran E12, E19, E20 fresh — all green, unchanged. `verified_commit` re-pinned to `ce0b13e6`. All other evals re-pinned without re-running (their own files untouched).

Round 8: all machine evals re-run fresh against `fix/mcp-auth`'s HEAD (e5ce7199); zero failures, no regressions from the http.ts bearer-check refactor.

## Gate 2 checklist (human)

- [ ] Read the table + spot-check 1-2 evidence blocks
- [ ] Personally verify every judgment item marked UNCERTAIN, then fill its
      `human_override: <name> <date>` line
- [ ] T3 only: personally verify ALL judgment items and fill `human_override`
      on each (judge verdicts are advisory; the hook blocks PASS without them)
- [ ] If verdict was PENDING-JUDGMENT: upgrade it to PASS (this write is when
      the hook re-validates evidence + overrides)
- [ ] Fill `human_signoff` in frontmatter + `time_human_minutes.gate2` in contract
